# jeevohome
This is a plugin for Jeedom 3.0 platform, regarding the Honeywell Evohome system.
State is : prototype

Written in php, the Jeedom main langage, a bit of javascript and of course some html, and, at this time,  some python bridges because all will be nothing without the excellent python library "evohome" from watchforstock. Great thanks to him.

It covers my needs to get a triggerable injection of full week scheduling in the main evotouch console.
Of course, the temperatures and setpoints are showed inside room components, with history availibity.
One connection is made per 10 mn to obtain full informations like temp. but also schedule for all the rooms.

On the general properties page, you have to set your username and password, which pair is the account you have to create/created on the official Honeywell web application (same as one linked with the phone's application).


Detailed explanations will come later..
Install and try, with your favorite FTP client. You must have the possibility to remove the plugin in case of general crash.
As you will see, the configuration is very simple.

Enjoy !
